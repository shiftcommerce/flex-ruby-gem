  # that stores whatever you want - it is an "OpenStruct" so you can just write anything to it and read it back at any time
  # This is cleared at the start of the context, but the idea is so that you can share stuff between examples.
  # This obviously means that the examples are tied together - in terms of the read, update and delete methods all rely
  # on having created an object in the first place.
  # This also means that this test suite must be run in the order defined, not random.
